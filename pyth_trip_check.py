# Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle, and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.
# Extra Credit
# If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order, change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order. Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.
# Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.

    a = raw_input("What is the first side of the triangle you want to check?\n ")
    b = raw_input("The second side?\n ")
    c = raw_input("And the third side? n")
